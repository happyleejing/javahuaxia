* Homework Description

Finish the Card class
```java
public class Card {
public static final String FACES[] = {"ZERO", "ACE", "TWO", "THREE",
"FOUR", "FIVE", "SIX", "SEVEN", "EIGHT", "NINE", "TEN", "JACK",
"QUEEN", "KING"}; public String suit;
private int face;
//constructors
//set methods
//get methods
public int getValue() { return face; } // equals method
public String toString() {
return FACES[face]+" of "+getSuit()+getValue();
} }
```

Next, finish the BlackJackCard class, for right now ACES count as 11 while TEN, JACK, QUEEN, and KING count as 10.

```java
public class BlackJackCard extends Card {
//constructors
public int getValue() {
//enables you to build the value for the game into //the card. This makes writing the whole program // a little easier
} }

```

Test your classes using the CardTestOne.java class
